# cs56-tutorials-hfj

Some simple programming exercises taken from the Head First Java book. The directories in this repository are organized by chapter.

* [Chapter 4](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Conrad/cs56-tutorials-hfj#chapter-4)
* [Chapter 10](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Conrad/cs56-tutorials-hfj#chapter-10)
* [Chapter 13](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Conrad/cs56-tutorials-hfj#chapter-13)

## Chapter 4

There are multiple samples from this chapter, which are organized into their own directories by page number.

* Original description for these assignments:

> The code samples on pages **71-79** or **80-86** (from Chapter 4) are, for the most part, not in the context of an entire class, so there is no way to run them.
>
So, your job is to write a set of classes and main programs that allows all of the code on those pages to be actually run and demonstrated. 
>
In addition, add Javadoc comments, an Ant build.xml file, and targets to run each of the examples.
>
Call your targets things like run71 run72 run73, etc. 
>
Or, if there is more than one code example on a page, you can make names that make sense such as run83_1 run83_2 etc.
>
You'll need to use your imagination to come up with what to put along with the code---e.g. some output (System.out.println( ... what??? ) so that you can see that the code is doing something.

## Chapter 10

Displays how to use static methods, in particular the Math class. The only example right now comes from pg 286 of HFJ.

## Chapter 13

Four GUI examples to demonstrate different layouts.

* Original Instructions

> Write some code that illustrates each of the Layout manager examples that is shown on pp. 401-412, as well as the example alluded to in in the "there are no dumb questions" of turning off the layout manager and just placing every widget manually. 
>
Give the example GUIs names that correspond to the pages numbers in the book, such as GuiPage401, GuiPage402, etc.
